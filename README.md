# Eye-Exercise

A demostration showing a pair of eyes moving and following the mouse cursor in the browser window. I really enjoyed this project.

# How to run

You do not need any special software to run, although Google Chrome is recommended. If you'd like to edit the code an editor is needed such as VS Code.

# Roadmap of future improvements

I would like to add a head or perhaps a pointed finger into the mix.
